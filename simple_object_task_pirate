Pirate Pursuit
Help Captain Edward Teach, aka Blackbeard, update his pirateProfile to evade his captors before he gets caught!

We need you to add, edit, and delete some of the properties without editing the original object directly:

To save Blackbeard:

- Add a new property to the pirateProfile called pirateName and set this to the value of 'Blackbeard'.
- Remove the realName property.
- Change the value of piecesOf8 on the treasure key to be 8 rather than 7.
- Change the shipName property to its new value of Queen Anne's Revenge.

ANSWER:

function createPirate() {
    const pirateProfile = {
        realName: 'Edward Teach',
        shipName: 'La Concorde',
        treasure: {
            gems: 10,
            piecesOf8: 7,
            goldCoins: 150
        }
    };
    pirateProfile.pirateName = 'Blackbeard'
    delete pirateProfile.realName
    pirateProfile.treasure.piecesOf8 = 8
    pirateProfile.shipName = "Queen Anne's Revenge"
    return pirateProfile;
}
