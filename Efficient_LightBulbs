Jim plans to buy new pack of assorted light bulbs.

He has heard that light bulbs are the most efficient when their serial number is an odd number has exactly six digits.
He would appreciate you writing some code that figured out which serial numbers met the criteria.

When this function runs, it will receive an array of serialNumbers - something like

[32438, 34193, 149143, 4329429, 98537, 238791, 23492, 298342]
You need to add code that will ensure Jim collects the serial numbers he wants to keep in the provided variable, efficientSerialNumbers.

For the above array, this would mean that efficientSerialNumbers should end up containing
[149143, 238791]

ANSWER:

function findEfficientBulbs(serialNumbers) {
    console.log(serialNumbers);
    const efficientSerialNumbers = [];
    for(let i = 0; i < serialNumbers.length; i++){
        const rightNumber = serialNumbers[i];
        if (rightNumber % 2 !== 0 && rightNumber > 99999 && rightNumber < 1000000)
                efficientSerialNumbers.push(rightNumber);
    }
    return efficientSerialNumbers;
}
